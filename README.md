Website brief:
Currently, planning a day out is a hassle. You need to look up each and every event individually, and figure out numerous logistics in between, such as transportation between them all. Each stop is an individual Google search. Currently, the market lacks an intuitive, convenient way to plan a day out. Our solution, “Big Dayte Out” looks to fill this gap by creating a website that allows you to plan a day out taking into account relevant factors such as transportation routes and times, nearby restaurants, budget, travel distance and even weather.
